Positive, Negative or Zero

Write a method called checkNumber with an int parameter number.
The method should not return any value, and it needs to print out:

	*"positive" if the parameter number is > 0
	*"negative" if the parameter number is < 0
	*"zero" if the parameter is equal to 0
	
NOTE: The checkNumber method needs to be defined as public static like we have been doing so far in the course.
NOTE: Don not add main method to your solution code!
