Shared Digit

Write a method named hasSharedDigit with two parameters of type int. 
Each number should be within the range of 10 (inclusive) - 99 (inclusive). If one of the numbers is not within the range, the method should return false.
The method should return true if there is a digit that appears in both numbers, such as 2 in 12 and 23; otherwise, the method should return false.

NOTE: The method hasSharedDigit should be defined as public static like we have been doing so far in the course.
NOTE: Do not add a main method to the solution code.
