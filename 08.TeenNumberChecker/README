Teen Number Checker

We'll say that a number is "teen" if it is in the range 13 -19 (inclusive).
Write a method named hasTeen with 3 parameters of type int.
The method should return boolean and it needs to return true if one of the parameters is in range 13(inclusive) - 19 (inclusive).
Otherwise return false.

Write another method named isTeen with 1 parameter of type int.
The method should return boolean and it needs to return true if the parameter is in range 13(inclusive) - 19 (inclusive).
Otherwise return false.

NOTE: All methods need to be defined as public static ​like we have been doing so far in the course.
NOTE: Do not add a  main method to solution code.
